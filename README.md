This is a sample project created using react. The result can be seen from [github.io](https://superoverflow.github.io/react-reviewer-rota)

## Background
The review rota is created to assign reviewers to each developer. The rule is that each developer will be assigned with two reviewers.
We don't want the reviewer to be overwhelmed. So each reviewer will only review two developers code.

## Todo
- Input validation: Reviewers must be more than 3
- Input validation: comma seperated
